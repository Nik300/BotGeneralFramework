## Introduction

BotGF aims to achieve three main goals:
- Simple setup for developers
- Out-of-the-box cross-compatibility
- Easy management for bot owners

### Short-term view

In the near future, BotGF should be able to manage multiple bot instances for many platforms with a single codebase. BotGF is also planned to support third-party plugins.

### Mid-term view

Facilitating the sharing of bot configurations and packages among developers is crucial. Creating a repository similar to npm but based on GitHub would be essential once the first stable version of BotGF is released. Managing a public registry would require too much time and resources.

### Long-term view

In the long term, BotGF aims to build a vibrant and supportive community of developers and users. To achieve this, BotGF wants to create a welcoming and inclusive environment that encourages developers, bot owners, and users to participate in the community. This could involve establishing a community code of conduct, hosting regular online events and activities, and providing resources and support for all members.

Additionally, BotGF envisions building a visual tool and hosting service that will make it easy for people without prior experience in system management or bot development to build and deploy their bots. The tool would feature a simple visual interface for importing packages and plugins to the server instance, as well as an easy-to-use visual editor for creating bot commands and events using code blocks.

By creating an open and inclusive community and providing user-friendly tools and services, BotGF aims to democratize chatbot development and make it accessible to everyone. BotGF hopes to empower a new generation of bot builders and drive innovation in the conversational AI space.
